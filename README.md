# How to Run the app from docker-compose


1) copy the code to your local machine 
2) go to the root directory of the app    (nest-serve-ionic-react/)
3) open the command line on that directory 
4) run docker-compose build
5) run docker-compose up 
6)  the app will be available on port 80






# Note 

* Make sure the ports are available and are not in use  by another app 

* If you want to take a look at the ionic app raw code before build you could 
* find it over this https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali-Ali-Ahmed/IonicReact-frontEnd GitHub Repo
